       Cyclists of all disciplines can agree on one thing; it is very expensive. One simply way to reduce costs of cycling is buying secondhand. BikeList will provide a local forum for which UVM students and faculty can exchange bikes. With a bit of maintenance and care, a used bike can be brand new, or even better.
